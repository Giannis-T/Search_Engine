Megadeth	School's Out	Well, we got no choice  All the girls and boys  Makin' all that noise  'Cause they found new toys  Well, we can't salute ya  Can't find a flag  If that don't suit ya  That's a drag    School's out for summer  School's out forever  School's been blown to pieces    No more pencils  No more books  No more teacher's dirty looks    Well, we got no class  And we got no principles  And we got no innocence  We can't even think of a word that rhymes    School's out for summer  School's out forever  School's been blown to pieces    No more pencils  No more books  No more teacher's dirty looks  Out for summer  Until fall  We might not go back at all    School's out for forever  School's out summer  School's out with fever  School's out completely
Barbra Streisand	Happy Days Are Here Again	So long sad times  Go long bad times  We are rid of you at last  Howdy gay times  Cloudy gray times  You are now a thing of the past    Happy days are here again  The skies above are clear again  So let's sing a song of cheer again  Happy days are here again    Altogether shout it now  There's no one  Who can doubt it now  So let's tell the world about it now  Happy days are here again    Your cares and troubles are gone  There'll be no more from now on  From now on...    Happy days are here again  The skies above are clear again  So, let's sing a song of cheer again  Happy times  Happy nights  Happy days  Are here again!
Dean Martin	Far Away Places	Far away places with strange sounding names    Far away over the sea    Those far away places with strange sounding names    Are calling, calling me    Going to China or maybe Siam    I want to see for myself    Those far away places I've been reading about    In a book that I took from the shelf    I start getting restless whenever I hear    The whistles of a train    I pray for the day I can get under way    And look for those castles in Spain    Oh they call me a dreamer    Well maybe I am    But I know that I'm burning to see    Those far away places with strange sounding names    Calling, calling me

Judy Garland	Easy To Love	You'd be so easy to love  So easy to idolize all others above  So worth the yearning for  So swell to keep every home fire burning for    And we would be so grand at the game  Carefree together that it does seem a shame  That you can't see your future with me  Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love    You'd be so easy to love    Easy to idolize all others above  So worth the yearning for  So swell to keep all the home fires burning for    We'd be so grand at the game  So carefree together that it does seem a shame  That you can't see your future with me  Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love    Easy to love  Easy to love
Gordon Lightfoot	Affair On 8Th Avenue	"The perfume that she wore was from some little store  On the down side of town  But it lingered on long after she'd gone  I remember it well  And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  Her long flowing hair came softly undone  And it lay all around  And she brushed it down as I stood by her side  In the warmth of her love  And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  And we played a game only she could win  And she told me a riddle I'll never forget  Then left with the answer I've never found yet  ""How long"", said she, ""Can a moment like this  Belong to someone?""  ""What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die  We must almost be born""  So if you should ask me what secrets I hide  I'm only your lover, don't make me decide  The perfume that she wore was from some little store  On the down side of town  But it lingered on long after she'd gone  I remember it well  And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  And we played a game only she could win  And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  "
Phineas And Ferb	What Does He Want?	What kind of present does he dream about  A leather wallet or a singing trout  What I should get him is a mystery  And if it's lame, will he still want me?  What does he want?  A dvd or some video games  What does he want?  Or maybe one of those new digital frames  What does he want?  Something to fit his personality  What does he want?  The perfect present is eluding me  My friends all tell me that I shouldn't obsess  But how can I avoid the stress?  I need to know, but right now all I can do is guess  What does he want?  A fancy cell phone or a tube of grout  What does he want?  I don't know, but I'll figure it out  What does he want?  Rear-view mirror glasses as seen on tv  What does he want?  I only wish I knew what he got me...  'Cause I hear it's perfect.  What does he want?
Alice In Chains	Brush Away	I could use some time to curl away  My aggression is where you stake your claim  Why I question this curve on which you grade  My conception, a joke or latest craze?  I try to get away, and yet I stick around  So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground    My intention, may I arrive at eight?  Lie and dream some, surprise you guys I'm late  All right, correction, forgetting something, wait  I try to get away, and yet I stick around (2x)  So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground  Brush away loose ground  Brush away
Lucky Dube	Is This The Way	Is this the way  You want it to be  Is this the way  It's gonna be  It's gonna be    Oh my God, oh my God  What we gonna do  In this world  In this world we live in  In this world we live in    I see these men  Every day at the corner  Of Queens and Commissioner  Begging for a dollar every day  Begging for a dime every day    Trying to make a living  Out there  But it's so hard  But it's so hard    Begging for a dollar  Begging for a dime  Begging for a dollar  Begging for a dime    One of them  Swallowed his pride  His broken pride  And came to me, he said  I quit, I give up  What are the rules  What did I do to deserve this  Begging for a dollar every day  Begging for a dime every day  Trying to make a living  Out there    Begging for a dollar  Begging for a dime
Squeeze	House Of Love	She was full of lies and boredom  It came as no surprise that she would cheat  Her nails were long and sharp  But she didn't play the harp  She wasn't an angel I told her  But she wasn't able to understand my words  Rich pickings in reverse  I wasn't Shakespeare  It's simple  Did she expect me  To kiss her feet    A very acidic tongue  Waggled in her head  Life was lots of fun  At times I had to smile  In front of everyone  We seemed the best of friends  Life had just begun  When on the roof a tile began to slip  The house of love caved in and that was it    She was full of tears by nature  It came to me so clear that she would creep  Her eyes were stale and spun  Like marbles in the sun  She wasn't a princess I told her  And so I witnessed the slaying of my life  That lasted half the night    I wasn't Jesus  Believe me  Our love was seedless  And incomplete
Nick Cave	Death Is Not The End	When you're sad and when you're lonely  And you haven't got a friend  Just remember that death is not the end  And all that you held sacred  Falls down and does not mend  Just remember that death is not the end  Not the end, not the end  Just remember that death is not the end  When you're standing on the crossroads  That you cannot comprehend  Just remember that death is not the end  And all your dreams have vanished  And you don't know what's up the bend  Just remember that death is not the end  Not the end, not the end  Just remember that death is not the end  When the storm clouds gather round you  And heavy rains descend  Just remember that death is not the end  And there's no-one there to comfort you  With a helping hand to lend  Just remember that death is not the end  Not the end, not the end  Just remember that death is not the end  For the tree of life is growing  Where the spirit never dies  And the bright light of salvation  Up in dark and empty skies  When the cities are on fire  With the burning flesh of men  Just remember that death is not the end  When you search in vain to find  Some law-abiding citizen  Just remember that death is not the end  Not the end, not the end  Just remember that death is not the end  Not the end, not the end  Just remember that death is not the end
Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat	Sluit Alle Deuren Maar	Sluit alle deuren maar  Doof alle sterren maar  Demp elk geluid  En verduister het licht    En ik lijd zonder bitterheid  Een dag of een eeuwigheid  Ik vraag niet om antwoord  Niet hier niet vandaag    Geef mij dan een nummer  In plaats van mijn naam  Ontken mij, vergeet mij  Ik heb niet bestaan    En ik lijd zonder bitterheid  Een dag of een eeuwigheid  Ik vraag niet om antwoord  Niet hier niet vandaag    Sloop al mijn dromen maar  Steel mijn geliefden maar  Kinderen van Israel  Zijn nooit alleen    En de wanhoop nabij,  Zal ik sterk zijn en vrij  Want mij is een land beloofd  En daar ga ik heen
Nat King Cole	I Think You Get What I Mean	My grammar ain't so good  And I've got no Ph.D  But there's more important things  Than a college degree    I think you get what I mean  I think you get what I mean  Your chick is all that matters  I think you get what I mean    There are ways to keep her happy  Ways to lose a tune  I don't take advice of no one  I know just what to do    I think you get what I mean  I think you get what I mean  Your chick is all that matters  I think you get what I mean    You give her lots of kisses  And dine her with good food  Work to keep her cheerful  And in a loving mood    I think you get what I mean  I think you get what I mean  Your chick is all that matters  I think you get what I mean    There're times when she'll stay out late  And you'll be feeling blue  Go on out and have a ball, son  She'll come running back to you    I think you get what I mean  I think you get what I mean  Have yourself a ball  I think you get what I mean
Dan Fogelberg	Looking For A Lady	Looking for a lady  I'm looking for a lady  To change my night to day    Looking for a lady  I'm looking for a lady  To chase my blues away.    Well, I have a few in mind  But none in particular  I have had them before  But nothing that was for sure.    And I'm in no position to barter  And I'm in no condition to play the martyr  And I'm sadder certainly  But I'm smarter  And I find myself.    Looking for a lady  I'm looking for a lady  To share my empty bed  Looking for a lady  I'm looking for a lady  To soothe my aching head.    Well, I have a few in mind  But none in particular  I have had them before  But nothing that was for sure.    And my feelings have grown  Rigid like a wooden post.  And my love is like a curtain  That has been drawn closed  And my life just isn't going  The way I thought it was supposed to  And I'm crying and I find myself.    Looking for a lady  I'm looking for a lady  To change my night to day.
