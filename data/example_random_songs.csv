Chuck Berry,Sweet Little Sixteen,They're really rockin' Boston  In Pittsburgh P. A.  Deep in the heart of Texas  And 'round the Frisco Bay  All over St. Louis  And down in New Orleans  All the cats want to dance with  Sweet little sixteen    Sweet little sixteen  She's just got to have  About half a million  Framed autographs  Her wallet filled with pictures  She gets 'em one by one  Become so excited  Watch her look at her run    Oh mommy mommy  Please may I go  It's such a sight to see  Somebody steal the show  Oh daddy daddy  I beg of you  Whisper to mommy  It's all right with you    'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  In Philadelphia P.A.  Deep in the heart of Texas  And 'round the Frisco Bay  All over St. Louis  Way down in New Orleans  All the cats want to dance with  Sweet little sixteen    'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand  Philadelphia P.A.  Deep in the heart of Texas  And 'round the Frisco Bay  All over St. Louis  Way down in New Orleans  All the cats want to dance with  Sweet little sixteen    Sweet little sixteen  She's got the grown up blues  Tight dresses and lipstick  She's sportin' high heel shoes  Oh but tomorrow morning  She'll have to change her trend  And be sweet sixteen  And back in class again    Well they'll be rockin' Boston  Pittsburgh P. A.  Deep in the heart of Texas  And 'round the Frisco Bay  Way out in St. Louis  Way down to New Orleans  All the cats want to dance with  Sweet little sixteen
Cliff Richard,All My Love,All my love  Came to nothin' at all my love  When I woke up to find  You were no longer mine  All my love  Throw away after all this time  Now there's no place for me  In the future you see  I don't understand you  I've done all I can do  Tell me how could I give you more  More than all my love  All my love  Came to nothin' at all my love  When I woke up to find  You were no longer mine  All my love  Throw away after all this time  Now there's no place for me  In the future you see  I don't understand you  I've done all I can do  Tell me how could I give you more  More than all my love  All my love  Came to nothin' at all my love  When I woke up to find  You were no longer mine  All my love  Throw away after all this time  Now there's no place for me  In the future you see  All my love  Came to nothin' at all my love

The Jam,The Modern World,This is a modern world this is the modern world  What kind of a fool do you think I am?  You think I know nothing of the modern world  All my life has been the same  I've learned to live by hate and pain  It's my inspiration drive  I've learned more than you'll ever know  Even at school I felt quite sure  That one day I would be on top  And I'd look down upon the map    The teachers who said I'd be nothing  This is the modern world that I've learnt about  This is the modern world we don't need no one  To tell us what's right or wrong  Say what you like 'cause I don't care  I know where I am and going too  It's somewhere I won't preview  Don't have to explain myself to you  I don't give two fucks about your review
Uriah Heep,My Joanna Needs Tuning,I was waiting for somebody  This afternoon  Hope that she remembered  Our rendezvouz  And when she didn't show  Just like yesterday  I do the last I'll find another way  One night I saw the stranger  Across the hall  I knew he was the reason  Why she didn't call  I wish I had imagined  Or dreamt the lot  But the heart didn't choose  The pain I've got  Now she' turning me inside out  Upside down  And me heart is all a roundabout  Spinnin' round  She's turnin' me inside out  Inside out  She's turnin' me inside out  Inside out  Now he's got all so melt  With a diamond ring  And she was thinking through  Almost anything  She's like a shadow going up  Seventh avenue  But so what she's only going  Where she's didn't to  I just got one thing to say  Just before I go  Since he was the offender  I want her to know  Now my mind has got me the day  I'm watching to  I'll never raise a thought  Of what she'd done      
Tears For Fears,Power,Last years rivals share their blood  Sailor sworn to secrecy  Ride the waves and stem the flood  The tides of endless enmity  Power now is all the rage  Sons and daughters of the gun  Hungry babies come of age  Phasers switched and set to stun  Power now power how power wow!  Here's power  If you're seeking power . . .  Doctor held you tight and torn  Boy he was a lucky man  Out of you the future born  Slight of foot and sight of hand  Douse the candle dim the light  Focus not on fire or flame  Don't believe that might is right  Your soul can turn you just the same  Power now power how power wow !  If you're seeking power - here's power  Power now power how power wow !  If you're seeking power - here's power  If you take my breath away  The whole damn thing will turn and return  Redefined rearranged rearranged  And till my dying the day  I guess I'll have to burn just to learn  This the time this the place  To show a human face  Dressed to kill we guessed you might  Friend or foe or family  We'll sacrifice the Virgin white  Her death will be the life of me  Power now is all the rage  Don't excuse it use it well  Keep the lion in his cage  Free from hunger free from hell  Power now power how power wow !  If you're seeking power - here's power!

Joni Mitchell,Lesson In Survival,Lesson in Survival  Spinning out on turns  That gets you tough  Guru books-the Bible  Only a reminder  That you're just not good enough  You need to believe in something  Once I could in our love  Black road  Double yellow line  Friends and kin  Campers in the kitchen  That's fine sometimes  But I know my needs  My sweet tumbleweed  I need more quiet times  By a river flowing  You and me  Deep kisses  And the sun going down    Maybe it's paranoia  Maybe it's sensitivity  Your friends protect you  Scrutinize me  I get so damn timid  Not at all the spirit  That's inside of me  Oh baby I can't seem to make it  With you socially  There's this reef around me  I'm looking way out at the ocean  Love to see that green water in motion  I'm going to get a boat  And we can row it  If you ever get the notion  To be needed by me  Fresh salmon frying  And the tide rolling in    I went to see a friend tonight  'Was very late when I walked in  My talking as it rambled  Revealed suspicious reasoning  The visit seemed to darken him  I came in as bright  As a neon light  And I burned out  Right there before him  I told him these things  I'm telling you now  Watched them buckle up  In his brow  When you dig down deep  You lose good sleep  And it makes you  Heavy company  I will always love you  Hands alike  Magnet and iron  The souls

King Crimson,Cage,"Walking down the street do you stare at your feet and never do you let youreyes meet the freaks The deadbeat addicts  social fanatics they're a dime a dozen and they carry guns    [Chorus]  Halloween every other day of the week  Living in a cage in the USA  Living in a cage in the USA  Holy smoke somebody blew up the pope  Living in a cage in the USA  All around us the rules are changing  Taller walls and stronger cages  Nothing is sacred or too outrageous  Taller walls and stronger cages    What in the world is happening to the world?  What in the world?  Driving in your Mercedes you think you're safe but you're never safe in aworld of hate with criminal minds with guns and  knives who say ""gimme your ride or give your life""    [Chorus]    What in the world is happening to the world?  What in the world?"
Kelly Clarkson,Breaking Your Own Heart,Shaking your head like it's all wrong  Before you're here you're already gone  And even with the light all around you  You're all alone in the dark.    You're breaking your own heart  Taking it too far down a lonely road  You say it's just one love  But when it's close enough you just let it go  The very thing you've been the most afraid of  You've been doing it from the start breaking your own heart.    Too many tears too many falls  It's easier here behind these walls  But you don't have to walk in the shadows  When life is so hard.    You're breaking your own heart  Taking it too far down a lonely road  You say it's just one love  But when it's close enough you just let it go  The very thing you've been the most afraid of  You've been doing it from the start breaking your own heart.    You're breaking your own heart.  It's not too late I'm still right here.  If only you let go of your fears.    You're breaking your heart  Taking your own heart down a lonely road  You say it's just one love  But when it's close enough you just let it go  The very thing you've been the most afraid of  You've been doing it from the start breaking your own heart.  You're breaking your own heart.

Rainbow,Lady Of The Lake,There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground  Makin' it shiver and shake  And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky  Slippery and sly like a snake    With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth  A shadow has covered the light  Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade  Has shattered the edge of the night    I know she waits below  Only to rise on command  When she comes for me  She's got my life in her hands    When a movement behind hit the side of my mind  I trembled and shook it away  Then another assault and I started to falter  Fibers of steel turned to clay    With a bubbly turn now the water should churn  And push it way from the core  And a lady in white will bring sun to the night  Brighter than ever before    I know she waits below  Only to rise on command  When she comes for me  She's got my life in her hands  Lady of the lake    There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground  Makin' it shiver and shake  And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky  Slippery and sly like a snake    With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth  A shadow has covered the light  Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade  Has shattered the edge of the night    Straight down I'm swirling around  Blinded and bruised by the strain  There must be some way to see  Diamonds out of the rain    I know she waits below  Only to rise on command  When she comes for me  She's got my life in her hands  Lady of the lake
Robbie Williams,16 Tons,"(Travis Merle)  Some people say a man is made outta mud  A poor man's made outta muscle and blood  Muscle and blood and skin and bones  A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong    You load sixteen tons what do you get  Another day older and deeper in debt  Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  I owe my soul to the company store    I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine  I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine  I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal  And the straw boss said ""Well a-bless my soul""    You load sixteen tons what do you get  Another day older and deeper in debt  Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  I owe my soul to the company store    I was born one mornin' it was drizzlin' rain  Fightin' and trouble are my middle name  I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion  Cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line    You load sixteen tons what do you get  Another day older and deeper in debt  Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  I owe my soul to the company store    If you see me comin' better step aside  A lotta men didn't a lotta men died  One fist of iron the other of steel  If the right one don't a-get you  Then the left one will    You load sixteen tons what do you get  Another day older and deeper in debt  Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  I owe my soul to the company store"
Nirvana,Baba O' Riley,Out here in the fields  I fight for my meals  I get my back into my living  I don't need to fight  To prove I'm right  I don't need to be forgiven    Don't cry  Don't raise your eye  It's only teenage wasteland    Sally take my hand  Travel south crossland  Put out the fire  Don't look past my shoulder  The exodus is here  The happy ones are near  Let's get together  Before we get much older    Teenage wasteland  It's only teenage wasteland  Teenage wasteland  Oh oh  Teenage wasteland  They're all wasted!
